# Playlist-Bot
This is a bot that downloads playlist's made or selected by the user. This uses pytube to get the playlist links. Selenium and ChromeDriver to control chrome and a website to download mp3 files. Also to run this code you need to download wsl(windows subsystem for linux). Later I might make a version of this to run on a mobile phone on termux.
